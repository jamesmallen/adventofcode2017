My solutions for [Advent of Code 2017](http://adventofcode.com/2017)

## Setup

I use Jupyter Notebook to develop/test my solutions quickly. If you want to get going yourself, you can install it using the following commands from within the git repository folder:

```bash
$ pip install jupyter
$ jupyter-notebook
```

This will start the backend and open up a web browser. Some handy keyboard shortcuts include:

- **Ctrl-Return**: execute the currently highlighted cell
- **Option-Return**: execute the currently highlighted cell and insert a new cell below it
